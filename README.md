# 25-26-GNC

The 2025-2026 CanSat mission requires that the payload be controlled by a paraglider system. This means having a robust control system to direct the payload to where it needs to go. A control system like this will take lots of iterations to get right. Therefore, the purpose of this repo is so that various people from both the Mechanical and Software sub-teams can work together to create this system.
